Thank you for adding new resources to this project!

To ensure consistency and easier maintenance (e.g., spotting duplicates), the items in each section are sorted alphanumerically.

Your recent changes don't follow this convention, so please ensure the section(s) you've edited are properly sorted.

The following sections are currently not sorted:

EOF

    for s in "${invalid_sections[@]}"; do
        echo " - $s" | tr -d "[]"
    done
fi

exit $exit_code
