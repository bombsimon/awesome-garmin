# awesome-generator

Tool to integrate with GitHub, GitLab and Connect IQ. It is currently helping
automate the process of updating the README but finding, adding or removing
resources is still a manual process.

## Generate README

The main purpose of this tool is to generate the [`README.md`] by reading
[`awesome.toml`] and fetching description, last activity and more from GitHub or
GitLab.

## Search

The tool supports searching the[Connect IQ app library] and print any
application that has a website URL linked which usually points to the source
code.

```sh
› cargo run search sailing

## Compare

To make it easy to maintain and discover new resources the tool can compare a
search result with the `awesome.toml` and print any diff in their respective
category.

```sh
› cargo run compare gitlab
